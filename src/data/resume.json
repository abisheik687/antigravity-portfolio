My work spans LLM-powered agents, Generative AI pipelines, and full-stack applications built to solve real-world problems—from AI-driven code debugging and talent matching to policy synthesis and data analysis.\n\nI’m not chasing titles. I’m looking for problems that demand depth, clarity, and intelligent engineering.",
